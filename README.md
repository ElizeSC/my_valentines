# 💖 My Valentine Vault

A cinematic, password-protected web experience built to send digital letters to the people who shape my journey. This project blends a "nerdy-lovergirl" scrapbook aesthetic with modern web practices.

## 🚀 Features
* **Secure Vault System:** Uses Base64 encoding and JSON data fetching to keep letters private.
* **Cinematic Transitions:** Custom CSS animations for a physical "opening the envelope" feel.
* **Guest Access:** A dedicated login for recruiters and public visitors to view my portfolio and philosophy.
* **Custom Branding:** Personalized typography and a custom SVG cursor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structural layout and scrapbook-style animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** To handle logic, data fetching, and decoding without heavy libraries.
* **JSON:** Used as a lightweight "database" to store user keys and messages.
