# to all my valentines,
[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/ElizeSC/my_valentines/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ElizeSC/my_valentines/actions)

A cinematic, password-protected web experience built to send digital letters to the people who shape my journey. This project blends a whimsical scrapbook aesthetic with modern web practices.

## 🚀 Features
* **Secure Vault System:** Uses Base64 encoding and JSON data fetching to keep letters private.
* **Cinematic Transitions:** Custom CSS animations for a physical "opening the envelope" feel.
* **Guest Access:** A dedicated login for recruiters and public visitors to view the page along with and philosophy.
* **Custom Branding:** Personalized typography and a custom SVG cursor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structural layout and scrapbook-style animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** To handle logic, data fetching, and decoding without heavy libraries.
* **JSON:** Used as a lightweight "database" to store user keys and messages.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance (QA)
To ensure the "vault" experience is seamless, I implemented an automated testing suite:
- **Playwright:** End-to-End (E2E) testing for the guest authentication flow.
- **CI/CD:** Integrated GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push.
- **Stability:** Solved animation-flakiness by injecting global CSS overrides during test execution, ensuring 100% reliable builds.
